[![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/H2H4330U3)

Set your game automatically up for use with CreamAPI.

## Features
* Setup CreamAPI’s DLLs and configuration file automatically.
* Find the AppID by providing the game’s name without having to look it up manually.
* Fetch a list of DLCs for an AppID from both the Steam Store and SteamDB.
* Set flags like "offline mode" and "extra protection" and select a language from a list.

## Installation
Download the latest release and extract it into any folder (e.g. `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\auto-creamapi`).

## Usage
* Double-click `auto-creamapi.exe` to open the application. (When starting it for the first time, it might take a few
 seconds since it needs to cache a list of games available on the Steam Store and download the latest CreamAPI DLL files.)
* Click on the *Open File* button on the top right and select the *steam_api.dll* or *steam_api64.dll* 
  **in the game folder**.
* Enter the name of the game and click on the *Search* button.
  * If it did not find the right game, either try again, or copy the app ID from the Steam Store to field to the right 
    of the *Search* button.
* Click the lower right *"Get DLCs for AppID"* button to fetch all available DLCs for the game.
* Select a language and tick the options if needed.
* Click on *"Save"*.
